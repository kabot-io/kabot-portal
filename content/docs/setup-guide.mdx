import { Step, Steps } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/steps';

To control your robot from a web browser, we cannot talk to DDS (the ROS middleware) directly. Instead, we use a WebSocket bridge that translates JSON from the browser into ROS 2 messages.



<Steps>

<Step>
### Install Rosbridge Suite

You need to install the `rosbridge_suite` package on your robot (or simulation computer). Replace `<distro>` with your ROS 2 version (e.g., `jazzy`, `iron`, `humble`).

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ros-jazzy-rosbridge-suite
```
</Step>

<Step>
### Launch the WebSocket Server

Run the launch file to start the server. By default, it listens on port **9090**.

```bash
ros2 launch rosbridge_server rosbridge_websocket_launch.xml
```

You should see output indicating the server has started:
```text
[INFO] [rosbridge_websocket]: Rosbridge WebSocket server started on port 9090
```
</Step>

<Step>
### Verification

To verify the connection is open, you can use `netcat` or simply open your browser's developer console on this page.

```bash
nc -zv localhost 9090
# Output: Connection to localhost 9090 port [tcp/*] succeeded!
```
</Step>

</Steps>

## Configuration

### Allowing Remote Connections
By default, the server might only accept connections from `localhost`. If you are running the website on a different device (like a phone or laptop) than the robot, you need to allow external addresses.

Run the launch file with the `address` parameter:

```bash
ros2 launch rosbridge_server rosbridge_websocket_launch.xml address:=0.0.0.0
```

### Changing the Port
If port 9090 is busy, you can change it:

```bash
ros2 launch rosbridge_server rosbridge_websocket_launch.xml port:=9091
```

*(Note: You will need to update the port in your `src/components/ros-provider.tsx` file to match).*

## Troubleshooting

### "Connection Refused"
1. Check if the terminal running `rosbridge_server` is still active.
2. Ensure no firewall (`ufw`) is blocking port 9090.

### "WebSocket Connection Failed"
If you are using **Firefox**, it strictly blocks connections to `ws://localhost` from non-secure sites. Try using Chrome or Edge, or ensure your Next.js app is running on `localhost` (not an IP address) during development.
