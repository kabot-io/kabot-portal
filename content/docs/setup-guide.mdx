# ROS2 Setup on local machine

Have you already set up ROS2 on your local machine? If not, please check the docs for [ROS2 Installation and Setup Guide](./ros-setup-guide).

### Attach Kabot-portal to ROS2

To attach kabot-portal to your ROS environment, we use a WebSocket bridge that translates JSON from the browser into ROS2 messages, because it is not possible to directly connect browser with ROS middleware.

<Callout type="warning" title="Network Accessibility">
It is important that your ROS2 websocket bridge is running on a machine that is reachable from your web browser. It generally means that you should be running it locally. If you are running ROS2 inside container, ensure that [`--network=host`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/network/drivers/host/) mode is enabled, or that the container ports are properly forwarded - ros bridge by default uses websocket connection over TCP port 9090.

<Steps>

<Step>
### Install Rosbridge Suite

You need to install the `rosbridge_suite` in your ROS environment.

<DistroTabs>
<Tab value="Humble">
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ros-humble-rosbridge-suite
```    
</Tab>


<Tab value="Jazzy">
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ros-jazzy-rosbridge-suite
```    
</Tab>

</DistroTabs>

</Step>

<Step>
### Launch the WebSocket Server

Run the launch file to start the server. By default, it listens on port **9090**.

<DistroTabs>
  <Tab value="Humble">
```bash
ros2 launch rosbridge_server rosbridge_websocket_launch.xml
```
</Tab>
<Tab value="Jazzy">
```bash
ros2 launch rosbridge_server rosbridge_websocket_launch.xml delay_between_messages:=0.0
```
<Callout>
Jazzy has the bug that parameter `delay_between_messages` default value is set to `0`, which is not parsed as double correctly. Setting it to `0.0` works around this issue.
</Callout>

</DistroTabs>

</Step>

<Step>
### Verify Connection
Once the server is running, check the connection status in the upper left corner of the web interface. It should change to "Connected". If it does, you're all set!
</Step>
