import { Step, Steps } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/steps';

To attach kabot-portal to your ROS environment, we use a WebSocket bridge that translates JSON from the browser into ROS 2 messages, because it is not possible to directly connect browser with ROS middleware.

<Steps>

<Step>
### Install Rosbridge Suite

You need to install the `rosbridge_suite` in your ROS environment.

<DistroTabs>
<Tab value="Humble">
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ros-humble-rosbridge-suite
```    
</Tab>


<Tab value="Jazzy">
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ros-jazzy-rosbridge-suite
```    
</Tab>

</DistroTabs>

</Step>

<Step>
### Launch the WebSocket Server

Run the launch file to start the server. By default, it listens on port **9090**.

<DistroTabs>
  <Tab value="Humble">
```bash
ros2 launch rosbridge_server rosbridge_websocket_launch.xml
```
</Tab>
<Tab value="Jazzy">
```bash
ros2 launch rosbridge_server rosbridge_websocket_launch.xml delay_between_messages:=0.0
```
<Callout>
Jazzy has the bug that parameter `delay_between_messages` default value is set to `0`, which is not parsed as double correctly. Setting it to `0.0` works around this issue.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>
### Verify Connection
Once the server is running, check the connection status in the upper left corner of the web interface. It should change to "Connected". If it does, you're all set!
</Step>
