### ROS2 Setup on local machine

To start working with Kabot, you need to have a ROS2 environment available. Either [installed locally](https://docs.ros.org/en/jazzy/Installation.html), or running in a container, for example using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). If you are runing Windows, working with [Windows Subsystem For Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) is recommended. Worth read are tutorials at [Articulated Robotics](https://articulatedrobotics.xyz/tutorials/), especially about this topic tutorial video about dev containers;
