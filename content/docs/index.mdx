## Talk to the Listener

Make sure your backend is running:
1. `ros2 launch rosbridge_server rosbridge_websocket_launch.xml`
2. `ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp listener`

Click the button below to send "Hello from Web!" to the listener.

<PublisherButton 
  topic="/chatter" 
  type="std_msgs/String" 
  data={{ data: "Hello from Web!" }}
>
  Send Message
</PublisherButton>

---

## Monitor the Topic

Below is a live view of the `/chatter` topic. Any message sent (by you or the terminal) will appear here.

<SubscriberCard topic="/chatter" type="std_msgs/String" />

### Test Loop
You can test this by opening a terminal and publishing a message repeatedly:

```bash
ros2 topic pub /chatter std_msgs/String "data: 'Hello from Terminal'"
```
